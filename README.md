  PluralKit is great. It helps untold numbers of systems communicate over Discord, providing them with robust tools for self-expression.<br>It's an invaluable resource for plural folk on the internet.<br><br>But as you may have noticed... It looks a bit crap, right?<br>
  <br>

  <br>
  These limitations aren't PK's fault. The bot uses <b>webhooks</b> to create proxy messages, which Discord just doesn't give features like custom name colours to. Nothing to do about it, unfortunately.<br>
  <br>
  Except, of course, if you could mod the client. Enter <b>Pluralchum</b>.<br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <b>Pluralchum</b> is a plugin for BetterDiscord that utilizes PluralKit's web API to provide better integration for proxied messages.<br>
  It brings features like coloured member names and system tags, optional text colouring, a special <code>PK</code> badge for proxied messages, and much* more!<br>

  Yeah, it's not perfect. I tried my best, but I am categorically not a web developer. I'm always looking to make it better, and some of these will likely be fixed in due time, but, y'know, be aware of them.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>- Major limitations -</b><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  1. <b>Member colours aren't updated when changed.</b><br>
  PC has no way of knowing when a member's colour changes. It only gets that information when it asks for an update from PK in the first place!<br>
  <br>
  <i>As a workaround, you can click the PK badge next to a user to request a member info update manually.</i><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Beyond that, there are likely to be loads of bugs and small issues I haven't spotted. Please don't hesitate to submit an <a href="https://github.com/estroBiologist/pluralchum/issues">issue</a> if something's wrong, and any contributions are greatly appreciated! (I apologize for my code.)
